*** Levels ***

D&D 4e contains monsters of level 1-36, with the highest levels for divine avatars & the like.
Strike! contains monsters of level [2 4 6 8 10 12] (odd levels can appear in custom monsters).

One possible map is:
1-6 = 2
7-12 = 4
13-18 = 6
19-24 = 8
25-30 = 10
31-36 = 12

That looks pretty dumb. High-level Strike! characters don't have the combat abilities of a demigod.

On the other hand, the iconic dragon is level 7 titan in Strike!, level 17-22 (elder white/red)in 4e. That isn't too far off.
(Arguably 4e should use the ancient white/red at level 24-30 to match the 4x4 size, but I'll just chalk that up to 4e not having titan rules and thus being hesitant to break out the truly massive sizes.)

So let's go with that for now. There will be a "match levels 1 to 1" option and a "match levels 1 to 1/3 rounded up" option.

            ** Ranks ***

* 4e            * Strike!

Elite           Elite
Solo            Champion
                Titan               (case-by-case; can't easily be auto-generated)
